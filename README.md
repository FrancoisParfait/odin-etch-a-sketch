TOP Project 4 - Etch A Sketch

INITIAL THOUGHTS:

Alright, fourth project here we go! I'm excited about this one, but also a little nervous. The lesson stressed that this one won't be easy, so I'm preparing myself mentally for the challenge. 

Because they're saying it won't be easy, I want to definitely avoid looking at solutions and try my best to problem-solve on my own, which I'm getting better at with each thing I work on. If I look for help, I'd like to go to TOP's discord or Stack Overflow, etc. I haven't asked questions yet and I think that's something I should get used to, since it's a big part of programming.

Anyway, that's it for my inital thoughts, let's get this thing going!
